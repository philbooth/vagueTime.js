# vagueTime.js

A tiny JavaScript library
that formats precise time differences
as a vague/fuzzy time.

## Why would I want that?

Displaying precise dates and times
can make a website feel stuffy and formal.
Using vague or fuzzy time phrases
like 'just now' or '3 days ago'
can contribute to a friendlier interface.

vagueTime.js provides a small, clean API
for converting timestamps
into user-friendly phrases,
heavily supported by unit tests.

## How tiny is it?

4.2 kb unminified with comments,
1.2 kb minified or
738 bytes minified+gzipped.

## What doesn't it do?

Older versions of this library
used to include translations into languages
other than English.
That translation process
was both [imperfect](https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js/issues/21)
and [a source of complexity](https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js/issues/8),
whereas the raison d'Ãªtre of this library
was to be small and simple.
Localisation is a separate problem,
better addressed by a dedicated solution.
So, in an effort to [do one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy),
the translation code was [removed](https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js/commit/fb0fd502c1a0d807fc2ec89cc0a40be8beeb4893).
Instead there is an option, `raw`,
which returns a translation-friendly object
containing the raw data.
The original translations are still available
in the [1.x branch](https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js/tree/1.x) and,
of course,
you are welcome to fork this repo
if you preferred things
how they were.

This library only converts
in one direction:
from dates/timestamps
to strings.
If you're interested
in the opposite transformation,
look elsewhere.

## How do I install it?

Via npm:

```
npm i vague-time --save
```

Or if you just want
the git repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:philbooth/vagueTime.js.git
```

## How do I use it?

### Loading the library

If you are running in
Node.js,
Browserify
or another CommonJS-style
environment,
you can `require`
vagueTime.js like so:

```javascript
var vagueTime = require('vague-time');
```

It also the supports
the AMD-style format
preferred by Require.js.

If you are
including vagueTime.js
with an HTML `<script>` tag,
or neither of the above environments
are detected,
the interface will be globally available
as `vagueTime`.

### Calling the exported functions

vagueTime.js exports a single public function, `get`,
which returns a vague time string
based on the argument(s) that you pass it.

The arguments are passed as properties
on a single options object:

* `from`:
  Timestamp or `Date` instance denoting the origin point from which the vague time will be calculated.
  Defaults to `Date.now()`.

* `to`:
  Timestamp or `Date` instance denoting the target point to which the vague time will be calculated.
  Defaults to `Date.now()`.

* `units`:
  String denoting the units that the `from` and `to` timestamps are specified in.
  May be `'s'` for seconds or `'ms'` for milliseconds.
  Defaults to `'ms'`.
  This property has no effect
  when `from` and `to` are `Date` instances
  rather than timestamps.

* `raw`:
  If this option is truthy,
  the raw data will be returned
  as a translation-friendly object
  in the following format:

  ```
  {
    v: number,
    u: string
  }
  ```

  Here,
  `v` is a number
  indicating the value
  of the vague time
  and `u` is a string
  indicating the units
  (either `'minute'`, `'hour'`, `'day'`, `'week'`, `'month'` or `'year'`).
  If the vague time is less than a minute,
  `v` will be `0`
  and `u` will be null.

Essentially,
if `to` is less than `from`,
the returned vague time will indicate
some point in the past.
If `to` is greater than `from`,
it will indicate
some point in the future.

### Examples

```javascript
const vagueTime = require('vague-time');

// returns 'in a minute'
vagueTime.get({
  to: Date.now() + 60000
});

// returns 'half an hour ago'
vagueTime.get({
  from: 1470001800,
  to: 1470000000,
  units: 's'
});

// returns 'in a couple of months'
vagueTime.get({
  from: new Date(2016, 10, 30),
  to: new Date(2017, 0, 31)
});

// returns { v: 2, u: 'month' }
vagueTime.get({
  from: new Date(2016, 10, 30),
  to: new Date(2017, 0, 31),
  raw: true
});
```

## How do I set up the dev environment?

Install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Lint the code:

```
npm run lint
```

Run the tests:

```
npm test
```

Or, to run the tests in a web browser,
open `test/vagueTime.html`.

## What changed between version 1.x and 2.x?

Support for languages
other than English
was removed in release `2.0.0`.
If you were relying on that stuff,
I'm sorry.
You may be interested in
the `raw` option
or the [1.x branch](https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js/tree/1.x).
